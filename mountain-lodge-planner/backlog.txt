TO DO
# When opening the navigation menu, make it disappear when user clicks outside the menu

DONE
# Show 'Editing data...' spinner after editing lodge
# Show 'Adding data...' spinner after adding lodge
# Fix the auto-focus in the addLodge component. After the put-request is resolved, the lodgeData in the main component is updated. Even though the addLodge component is shown, the input is only focused after the get-request of the updateData is resolved.
# Add the option to add neighbouring lodges
  - Make sure to also adjust the data of the neighbouring lodge
# Deleting an adjacent lodges causes some major problems. Maybe adding a state in the SelectAdjacentLodge component will fix this. - The problem was solved by creating a unique id for each SelectAdjacentLodge component that is NOT the index of its place in the array. Using the index causes problems when the array in the state is updated.
# In the adjacent lodge select options, the lodge itself should not be an option. Filter this one out. - Not only the lodge itself, but any other lodge that is already choses is also filtered out. Therefore, there is no way to add the same lodge twice.
# Make sure that a new window starts at the top of the page and not at the same scroll level as the previous component.
# Prevent the router to go to the previous page when a user clicks cancel after clicking delete (intentionally or intentionally, who knows) in the edit window
